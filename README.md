## Migrating to Terraform from using the Dashboard

Do you have an existing Cloudflare account (or many!) that you'd like to transition
to be managed via Terraform? Check out [cf-terraforming](https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming)
which is a tool Cloudflare has built to help dump the existing resources and
import them into Terraform.
